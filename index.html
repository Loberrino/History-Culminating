<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie was a solider and educator during the first world war</li>
<li>He was the first Canadian Commander of the Canadian Corps</li>
<li>Currie is most well known for his excellent planning and leadership; particularly during the Hundred Days Campaign of August 8th-November 11th 1918</li>

<h3 id="org671a798">How were they involved with that happened? What was their role in the War?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org671a798">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie started with no professional military experience but several years in the Canadian Militia</li>
<li>A friend of his; Garnet Hughes, junior officer of the 50th regiment, convinced his father Sam Hughes to offer Currie a position in the Canadian Expeditionary Force
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In September 1914, he became the commander of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade and largely started his rise</li>
<li>Currie took $10,000 from the 50th Regiment&rsquo;s funds before accepting this position to pay for debts and evade bankruptcy; something that would come back to haunt him</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>He would then cross the Atlantic with the First Canadian Contingent, arriving in England in October 1914</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The troops would spend the winter training in Salisbury Plain under British General E.A.H Alderson</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In February 1915 the Canadians crossed the English Channel, and by April they transferred to Ypres</li>
<li>After heavy losses meant recruitment was no longer meeting demand, as well as pressure from P.M Borden and the Union Coalition, Currie publicly supported Conscription in December 1917
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This would lead to heavy criticism from Liberal Politicians who accused him of callous disregard for his soldiers&rsquo; lives</li>
</ul></li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6184d7a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie goes down in history as one of the ablest generals of the War</li>
<li>He led the Canadian Corps to several important victories; particularly during the Hundred Days Campaign</li>
<li>Currie&rsquo;s ability toward leading some of the most impressive assaults in the war gave Canada international acclaim for their soldiers being some of the best in the war</li>

<li>In April 1915 after being transerred to Ypres, Currie and his troops participated in the Second Battle of Ypres (April-May) which included the first use of Chlorine Gas in war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie&rsquo;s brigade lost about half their strength during this battle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In June 1916 Currie&rsquo;s division played a part in a well-planned successful counterattack at Mount Sorrel</li>
<li>In September, the Canadian Corps then arrived at the Battle of the Somme where they sufferred heavy losses for little gain</li>
<li><b>Finally in April 1917 the Canadians executed the Battle of Vimy Ridge orchestrated by Byng and executed by Currie and other officers and men of the Corps</b></li>
<li>Currie would then become Commander of the Canadian Corps in 1917</li>
<li>From there in August, him and his Corps would achieve a hard-won victory at Hill 70</li>
<li>Then in October, they&rsquo;d move North to join the Passchendaele campaign
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Though he was largely forced into this, Currie carefully planned a four-phase attack which would take place on October 26 to November 10</li>
<li>Both the battles of Passchendaele and Hill 70 were successful; though at very heavy losses (almost 300,000 dead or wounded)</li>
<li>This contributed heavily to the rumours among troops of him being a callous and cold-hearted leader who sacrificed Canadian Soldiers for his own reputation</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Without Currie, many of the most important battles in the war&rsquo;s history might never have gone successfully as they did</li>
<li><b>After the addition of a Second Canadian Divison, Currie became commander of the 1st Caandian Division in September 1915</b></li>
<li>Byng was eventually appointed to command one of the British armies and recommended Currie as his replacement
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie was knighted and became commander of the Canadian Corps on June 9th 1917; the first Canadian to hold said post</li>
<li>Shortly after this, he defied the wishes of Sam Hughes by appointing Archibald Cameron Macdonell to command the 1st Division instead of Garnet</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Around this time, rumours of embezzlement began to circulate around Currie
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The affair came to the attention of Prime Minister Borden in 1917 who refused to court-martial &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s Best Soldier&rdquo;</li>
<li>Currie did borrow money to repay these funds, but his reputation was already beyond repair with Politicians back home whereas on the battlefront he remained well-respected</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Currie&rsquo;s excellent leading and planning of the Hundred Days Campaign which ended the war and was the most successful of all the Allied Offensives</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Canadians won several monumental victories under Currie&rsquo;s leadership, including <b>the battle of Amiens, Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Mons</b></li>

Arthur Currie goes down in History as one of the best leaders of the entirety of WWI, and is one of if not the main person responsible for earning the Canadians their formidable reputation as fierce Soldiers. He led many
crucial battles; such as a participation in the Second Battle of Ypres, Battle of the Somme, Battle of Vimy Ridge, and the Passchendaele Campaign. Becoming the First Canadian Commander of the Canadian Corps is not something
that comes lightly, but it was Currie&rsquo;s immense attention to detail and experience that created some of the most crucial successes in the entire war; and for us Canadians today. Despite this, naturally, he wasn&rsquo;t perfect and
sufferred much controversy too. Prior to becoming Commander of the 2nd Canadian Infantry, Currie embezzled $10,000 from the 50th regiment to pay off personal debts of his. Rumours of this would begin circulating and even reach
the Prime Minister in 1917; though he refused to court-martial &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s Best Soldier&rdquo;. Additionally, that same year, he would openly go on to support the idea of Conscription after heavy losses on the warfront and not enough
Soldiers signing up to meet the need, alongside pressure from Prime Minister Borden and the Union Coalition. All of this led to a reputation of a callous leader with little regard for his soldiers&rsquo; lives. Many of the battles
that he led; such as the battle of Passchendaele and the Second Battle of Ypres experienced incredibly heavy losses for, in some cases, little benefit. In my opinion, Arthur Currie is well and truly a successful person in
History and deserved to be remembered as such. He&rsquo;s an icon of the capability Canadian peoples can have; truly being the main person responsible for Canadian Soldiers being known as potentially the best Soldiers the war had.
He was believed to be very cold and careless with his Soldiers&rsquo; lives which I believe to be very inaccurate, though that&rsquo;s getting more so into personal belief. We have Arthur Currie to thank for Canada being able to display
it&rsquo;s independence from England, and he goes down in History as a tremendous leader of war.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Arthur was seen as a kind of person who <i>did what was necessary</i>
<ul class="org-ul">

</ul></li>
<li>Though it comes down to personal opinion, there is a lot in favour of Currie&rsquo;s reputation being false, and him caring a lot for his troops and just generally being a caring person faced with a brutal job</li>
<li>Sir Arthur Currie wasn&rsquo;t affable or charismatic, but what he was is efficient, intelligent, and strategic.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7054076">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>During the entirety of the Great Depression, Canadians found themselves very frustrated with the mostly dual-party political system
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mackenzie King of course was already under scrutiny and then blew everything up through the 5 Cent Speech, and Bennett of the Conservatives after him didn&rsquo;t find he could do very much to help the Economic Depression</li>
<li>Many new Parties rose from these conditions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This leads to the rise of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation; founded in Calgary in 1932
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Shortly after forming, in 1933, the party met in Regina to declare James Shaver Woodsworth the first president of the party
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Woodsworth had been a Social Worker, as well as a Manitoba Independent Labour Party MP since 1921</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Through the Regina Manifesto, they wanted to:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eliminate Class/Economic based Division</li>
<li>Provide people with a proper &ldquo;genuine Democratic self-government based upon economic equality&rdquo;</li>
<li>A mixed economy through Nationalization of key industries</li>
<li>A Welfare state with Universal Pensions</li>
<li>Health and Welfare Insurance</li>
<li>Family allowances</li>
<li>Employment Insurance</li>
<li>and Workers&rsquo; Compensation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strangely, going into WWII, the C.C.F was split between supporters of Canada&rsquo;s entry into the war, and supporters of Woodsworth&rsquo;s relentless Pacifism
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Major James William Coldwell who succeeded Woodsworth as party leader, favoured Canada&rsquo;s participation in the war</li>
<li>Under his moderate guidance, the party flourished and won the critical York South by-election in early 1942</li>
<li>This meant PM Arthur Meighen of the Conservatives was unable to win a seat in the House of Commons</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The C.C.F would eventually influence reforms such as employment insurance
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They would later form into the NDP which would largely be responsible for things such as Universal Medicare</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Although the C.C.F (and NDP even decades after it) never held national power as the Liberals and Conservatives have, they&rsquo;ve greatly contributed to the development of the <b>Canadian Welfare State</b></li>
<li>In 1935, seven C.C.F MPs were sent to Ottawa where the party captures 8.9% of the popular vote
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In 1940, eight MPs were elected with 8.5% of the popular vote</li>

<li>The Party at last took office in Saskatchewan under Tommy Douglas

<li>Of course, Douglas would go on to largely restore the province from decay and introduce ideas such as Universal Medicare and a pension plan which would be adopted Nationally</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb4dc3a3">
<p>
I believe that the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was an astounding success; perhaps being <i>the only</i> party formed from the frustrations of the Great Depression to be a success in any particular way. The C.C.F began as
a small Party in Regina between an unlikely mix of Farmers&rsquo; Organizations, Academics in the LSR, and a Ginger Group of MPs in Ottawa. They were incredibly progressive and wanted to establish Socialism in Canada; going on to
quickly write the Regina Manifesto which included many ideas which would go on to be established on a National Level such as Free Healthcare, Employment Insurance and Pensions, and just generally a Pacifistic approach to many
policies as well. They were a shining light filled with excellent ideas during a time when the Capitalist Economy of Canada; as well as the entire world, had proven it&rsquo;s weakest points in every way. Though they started out
small, they quickly gained much traction; particularly leading into WWII, and quickly established many members of Parliament as well as several Provincial Government leaders. This included Tommy Douglas of Saskatchewan, who
would go on to establish many policies and changes that would entirely revive the province, and even be adopted nationally. Following WWII, with rising tensions regarding Communism, the Party was then accused of it and lost
much of it&rsquo;s popularity. This is when they had to create an arrangement with the Canadian Labour Congress and in 1961 they emerged from a Founding Convention as the <span class="underline">New Democratic Party.</span> That, I would consider their greatest
failure of them all; however, the NDP still goes on to be a very important Progressive Party both in Provincial and Federal levels in Canada, and because of their status still being alive and strong, and their birth out of
the frustrations of a flawed Political System, I would consider the C.C.F and the N.D.P a resounding success.

<h3 id="org9eb6454">What happened?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9eb6454">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The NEP was an energy policy of the Government of Canada whose goal was to ensure that Canada could supply its own oil and gas needs by 1990</li>
<li>After about 2 years of the Program&rsquo;s existence, it began being shut down in phases
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Global economic conditions meant the NEP was no longer very necessary or useful</li>
<li>Offshore drilling, the development of Oil Sands, and a rise in Western alienation and the development of the modern Conservative Party all added to the NEP&rsquo;s complicated legacy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since the early &rsquo;60s, the Federal Government had been involved in regulating and developing the Canadian oil and gas industry
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>During 1961-1973, they maintained a protected market for Western Canadian oil to help see growth in the industry</li>
<li>Two massive Oil crises in the &rsquo;70s encouraged the Government to secure oil resources for Canadian Consumers by being more active in developing the Canadian Oil and Gas sector hence the reason for the NEP&rsquo;s existence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The NEP required much more Federal Government involvement in the energy sector to accomplish it&rsquo;s goals
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Government would therefore encourage new funding for research and development&#x2026; Which <b>came with new Taxes</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The NEP encouraged more local participation in Oil, and also helped consumers switch to Natural Gas and electricity for home heating to conserve Oil</li>
<li>Sources of controversy against the NEP included the fear that Provinces would lose an important source of revenue, as well as the limitations on Private Industry and Royalties paid to oil-producing Provinces that came with Price Controls. Finally, the NEP was based on the idea that access to cheap Oil and Gas was a more public need than a free-market commodity
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The NEP&rsquo;s goal was driven by the need to keep consumer costs as low as possible whereas the Free Market is driven by profit&#x2026; Conflict</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As Global Oil prices declined from 1983 to 1985, negotiations continued over the NEP to help Private Industry
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By this point, the Economic Conditions that led to the creation of the NEP no longer existed</li>
<li>PM Mulroney therefore proposed a new Energy Policy during his first term in Office which aimed to address the changes in the global Oil Market</li>
<li>The Western Accord on Energy went into effect on June 1, 1985 and ended the NEP and over 20 years of Federal Government Protectionism and regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry</li>

<li>The Program was created by the Federal Government of Canada under Pierre Trudeau&rsquo;s Liberal Party</li>
<li>Later, in 1981, a Federal-Provincial deal was made, and Peter Lougheed; the Alberta Premier, became involved</li>
<li>Even before the NEP, the country had developed many Crown Corporations to play a variety of economic and policy roles in the decades before</li>
<li>Many Provincial Governments and Premiers felt the Federal Government&rsquo;s new involvement in Oil and Gas would lose them important sources of revenue</li>
<li>Complicating the situation even further was the recent Quebec Referendum on Sovereignty in 1980
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trudeau promised constitutional negotiations between the Provincial and Federal Governments, and negotiations over the constitution of the NEP dominated Canadian Politics throughout 1981</li>
<li>The Quebec Premier: Rene Levesque, was now directly involved, pushing for a looser association where Provinces gad greater control over their own affairs, alongside many other Premiers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Oil-Producing Provinces were paid Royalties by the NEP</li>
<li>The Entire Private Industry of Oil, Gas, and Natural Energy as a whole were now subject to very limited profits</li>

<h3 id="orgf92ad23">When and where did the events take place? Give details</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf92ad23">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Energy Policy was created in the year of 1980 and lasted until 1985
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The program wanted to meet it&rsquo;s goals by 1990</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Federal-Provincial deal was made to resolve controversial segments of the NEP in 1981
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Starting the next year, however, the program was then dismantled in phases</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdc54c77" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdc54c77">Why is this event important to Canada? Why should we remember it?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdc54c77">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The main objective of the Program was <b>Protectionism</b> for the country&rsquo;s energy consumption
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They wanted to increase Canada&rsquo;s participation in Oil and Gas, establish fair energy pricing for Canadian Consumers, and ultimately secure Canada&rsquo;s Oil and Gas supply</li>
<li>It would also have made the market closed off; no more dependence on the world price of Oil, or Oil Imports, and Consumers would gain access to made-in-Canada Oil at <i>controlled prices</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This marks one of many big instances of Provincial and Federal Governments opposing one another
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Governments from Provinces such as Alberta feared the NEP and Canada&rsquo;s new Energy Policy would lose them a large revenue source</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The decay of the NEP led to Mulroney&rsquo;s Government establishing the Western Accord on Energy in 1985
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This ended the over 20 years of Federal Government Protectionism and Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many of the economic factors that led to the Program&rsquo;s creation no longer applied by when it was finally created
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Global Economic and Political trends shifted in favour of deregulation and privatization in the economy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The NEP now reflects Canada&rsquo;s participation in these growing international trends</li>
<li>Though it failed, the NEP played a key role in the development of Canada&rsquo;s modern energy industry</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org619481b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org619481b">Why is the event important during this time period?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org619481b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Program was incredibly controversial; it was initially popular with consumers and a symbol of Canadian Economic Nationalism, but private industry and some Provincial Governments opposed it</li>
<li>The main objectives of the NEP were to increase Canada&rsquo;s participation in Oil and Gas, make energy pricing fair for Canadian Consumers, and secure Canada&rsquo;s supply for Oil and Gas
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This would&rsquo;ve been a big deal at the time; the Program&rsquo;s success would mean Canada&rsquo;s energy-independence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Federal Government being more involved with the energy sector introduced more Taxes and Price Controls</li>
<li>Natural Resources traditionally were the responsibility of the Provinces, and Premiers such as Peter Lougheed thought such a major change in Canada&rsquo;s energy policy should have involved Provincial Consultation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many Provinces feared they&rsquo;d lose an important revenue source due to the change</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Compromise agreed upon in 1981 between Federal and Provincial Governments involved the Federal Government agreeing to modify price controls and regulations, and Provinces agreeing that the Federal Government had a right to special Taxes designed to increase Federal Revenue</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf67bef" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcf67bef">Why was it so important to establish Protectionism in the Oil and Gas Markets specifically?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcf67bef">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Well&#x2026; It wasn&rsquo;t. This form of Economic Nationalism and direct intervention in the economy was not new in Canada by the time the NEP came to be
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prior to it, the country developed Crown Corporations to play a variety of economic and policy roles earlier in the century</li>
<li>While Canada&rsquo;s economy became less centrally controlled after WWII, the Government remained involved in many industries throughout a lot of the Cold War</li>

<div id="outline-container-org78b52aa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78b52aa">What happened?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78b52aa">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The North America Free Trade Agreement was an economic free trade agreement signed between Canada, the US, and Mexico
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This would eliminate every single trade border and all investment barriers between the countries</li>
<li>This agreement built upon the previously signed Canada-US Free Trade Agreement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Over the course of the &rsquo;80s and into the &rsquo;90s, many Political and Economic factors led to the creation of NAFTA
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The idea was initially raised by President Reagan in 1979, but both Canada and Mexico showed no interest towards it over their wariness of US dominance</li>
<li>In 1984, however, after PM Mulroney was put in office following Trudeau, his Progressive Conservative Party led to the creation of CUSFTA</li>
<li>This was met with strong opposition from the Liberal and New Democratic Parties and much of the general public</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Later, the idea to include Mexico was much more controversial, following 1981-82 when Mexico experienced a debt crisis
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mexico had originally followed a Nationalist Economic Model which needed to change, so they gradually opened up their economy</li>
<li>With pressure from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, they joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T) in 1986</li>
<li>Many remained Skeptical of the stability of the Mexican Economy, and in 1990 PRI President Carlos Salinas de Gortari travelled to Europe to try and convince the continent that Mexico had changed&#x2026; European States and Investors weren&rsquo;t interested in the Mexican Market regardless, however</li>
<li>Eventually, Salinas approached the US with an offer to create a Free Trade Agreement, which complemented the trade objectives of the Bush Administration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>During this time, European countries had began mostly trading among themselves, and so a Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada was seen as a way of advancing US objectives dor deeper levels of Liberalization</li>
<li>Canada was not initially part of the talks, but PM Mulroney eventually chose to join despite reluctance from the Government and Business Leaders</li>
<li>Finally, after 14 intense months of negotiations, between 1991 and 1992, NAFTA was signed</li>
<li>The Agreement saw criticism in Canada and the US, as it was seen to be dominated by corporate interests, and fears arose of poor working conditions, low environmental standards, and the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the two countries to Mexico</li>
<li>The effects of NAFTA on the economies of the three countries are difficult to objectively evaluate, but a lot of the discussion surrounding NAFTA&rsquo;s impact ended up being incredibly polarized
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most representatives from the three countries praised the Agreement as having a very beneficial impact</li>
<li>NAFTA overall had a major impact on the Canadian Economy, and has exponentially increased trade between the three countries in a few decades</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to note that regional supply chains were a big side effect of the agreement
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many economic sectors; particularly automobiles, have become very integrated across the continent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many argued that increased trade didn&rsquo;t lead to improved standards of living in the tree countries; particularly Mexico who saw little economic growth since the Agreement&rsquo;s creation, while inequality and poverty rates remained high
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The brutal impact of Liberalization on much of Mexico&rsquo;s population fueled the rapid increase in their increased migration to the US after NAFTA&rsquo;s implementation, despite claims that NAFTA would reduce migration by creating jobs in Mexico prior to the agreement being put into effect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Canada sufferred greatly from Chapter 11 on Investment within the Agreement; giving way to many lawsuits against Canada from the other countries
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most cases brought against Canada challenged Government Policies aimed at Protecting the Environment or Managing Resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since NAFTA didn&rsquo;t create any significant institutions, there was little room for co-operation between the three countries after the Agreement was signed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Following 9/11, a new form of co-operation - motivated primarily by US security concerns, was implemented</li>
<li>Along it&rsquo;s two land borders, the US began involving the individual inspection of virtually all vehicles done by border agents, which slowed trade between the countries down to a crawl</li>
<li>Agreements were signed between Canada and the US, and Mexico and the US to improve the state of things, but cross-border movement of goods and people remained constrained</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orga35d0a8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga35d0a8">Who was involved? How were they involved?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga35d0a8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All 3 countries were, by design, heavily involved in the deal, but Political Co-operation between them remained very weak
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In 2017, Trump began threatening to renegotiate or cancel NAFTA altogether</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The idea of NAFTA was initially raised by President Reagan in <b>November 1979</b> under his candidacy for Presidency</li>
<li>PM Mulroney and his Government led to the creation of CUSFTA, but there was also strong opposition to it within the Liberal the New Democratic Parties, as well as from the general public</li>
<li>As a desperate measure of sorts to open Mexico&rsquo;s economy, PRI President Salinas and his closest advisors approached President Bush to formally propose a Free Trade Agreement with the US</li>
<li>The agreement was finally signed by President Bush, PRI President Salinas, and PM Mulroney</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org0f1fa8b">When and where did the events take place? Give details</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0f1fa8b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Free Trade Agreement took effect on <b>January 1st, 1994</b></li>
<li>It was, of course, between all of North America</li>
<li>The Canada-US Free Trade Agreement that came before it on <b>January 1st 1989</b> led to NAFTA&rsquo;s creation</li>
<li>Following the Controversial History of the Agreement, as well as decisions headed by President Trump, more than a year of negotiations led to a revised version of NAFTA called <b>CUSMA</b> being created and taking effect on <b>July 1st 2020</b></li>
<li>Initially when the idea was raised, Trudeau was in Office and was wary of US dominance, but in <b>1984</b> under PM Mulroney, CUSFTA was now a possibility</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04e37f0">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It was, of course, a significant deal for Canada to be involved in the largest free trade area in the world; being one of 3 countries to be involved
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although the Politics of NAFTA have fallen through many hoops, they still hold precedence over modern North American Politics</li>
<li>It was largely NAFTA that led to the creation of the Canada, U.S, Mexico Agreement (C.U.S.M.A) after it</li>

<div id="outline-container-org160cea5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org160cea5">Why is the event important during this time period?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org160cea5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NAFTA was one of the most ambitious trade agreements in all of History; resulting in the world&rsquo;s largest free trade area</li>
<li>The Free Trade Agreement would go a long way toward impacting the economy of all countries involved; Skepticism followed from a lot of the public in Canada and the US</li>
<li>The Agreement saw criticism in Canada and the US, as it was seen to be dominated by corporate interests, and fears arose of poor working conditions, low environmental standards, and the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the two countries to Mexico</li>

<div id="outline-container-org95a49eb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org95a49eb">Why was it that President Trump wanted to renegotiate/cancel NAFTA so heavily?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org95a49eb">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trump opposed NAFTA with rhetoric especially focused on Mexico over fears of jobs being stolen by Mexico for decades, and the general sentiment that Mexico benefitted from NAFTA at the US&rsquo; expense</li>
<li>Finally in 2017 Trump threatened to renegotiate or cancel the deal
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After more than a year of negotiations, Canada and the US reached an agreement in principle on October 1st, 2018</li>
