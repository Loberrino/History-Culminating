<li>Currie was a <i>solider and educator</i> during the first world war</li>
<li>He was the <b>first Canadian Commander of the Canadian Corps</b></li>
<li>Currie is most well known for his excellent planning and leadership; particularly during the Hundred Days Campaign of August 8th-November 11th 1918</li>
<li>It was Arthur Currie who led some of the most important Canadian battles of the war; such as the <b>battle of Vimy Ridge, the second battle of Ypres, and the battle of Passchendaele</b></li>

</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie started with no professional military experience but several years in the Canadian Militia</li>
<li>In September 1914, he became the commander of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade and largely started his rise
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Currie took $10,000 from the 50th Regiment&rsquo;s funds before accepting this position to pay for debts and evade bankruptcy; something that would come back to haunt him</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>He would then cross the Atlantic with the First Canadian Contingent, arriving in England in October 1914</li>
<li>In February 1915 the Canadians crossed the English Channel, and <b>by April they transferred to Ypres</b></li>
<li>Later on in his career, after heavy losses meant recruitment was no longer meeting demand, as well as pressure from P.M Borden and the Union Coalition, <b>Currie publicly supported Conscription in December 1917</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This would lead to heavy criticism from Liberal Politicians who accused him of callous disregard for his soldiers&rsquo; lives</li>

</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie goes down in history as one of the ablest generals of the War</li>
<li>Currie&rsquo;s ability toward leading some of the most impressive assaults in the war gave Canada international acclaim for their soldiers being some of the best in the war</li>
<li>In April 1915 after being transferred to Ypres, Currie and his troops participated in the Second Battle of Ypres (April-May) which included the first use of Chlorine Gas in war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie&rsquo;s brigade <i>lost about half their strength</i> during this battle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In June 1916 Currie&rsquo;s division played a part in a well-planned successful counterattack at Mount Sorrel</li>
<li>In September, the Canadian Corps then arrived at the Battle of the Somme where they sufferred heavy losses for little gain</li>
<li><b>Finally in April 1917 the Canadians executed the Battle of Vimy Ridge orchestrated by Byng and executed by Currie and other officers and men of the Corps</b></li>
<li>Currie would then become Commander of the Canadian Corps in 1917</li>
<li>Then in October, they&rsquo;d move North to join the Passchendaele campaign
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both the battles of Passchendaele and Hill 70 were successful; though at very heavy losses (almost 300,000 dead or wounded)</li>
<li>This contributed heavily to the <b>rumours among troops of him being a callous and cold-hearted leader</b> who sacrificed Canadian Soldiers for his own reputation</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Without Currie, many of the most important battles in the war&rsquo;s history might never have gone successfully as they did</li>
<li><b>After the addition of a Second Canadian Division, Currie became commander of the 1st Canadian Division in September 1915</b></li>
<li>Currie was knighted and became commander of the Canadian Corps on June 9th 1917; the first Canadian to hold said post
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Shortly after this, he defied the wishes of Sam Hughes by appointing Archibald Cameron Macdonell to command the 1st Division instead of Garnet</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Around this time, <b>rumours of embezzlement began to circulate around Currie</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The affair <i>came to the attention of Prime Minister Borden</i> in 1917 who <b>refused to court-martial &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s Best Soldier&rdquo;</b></li>
<li>Currie did borrow money to repay these funds, but his reputation was already beyond repair with Politicians back home whereas on the battlefront he remained well-respected</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Currie&rsquo;s excellent leading and planning of the Hundred Days Campaign which ended the war and was the most successful of all the Allied Offensives</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Canadians won several monumental victories under Currie&rsquo;s leadership, including <b>the battle of Amiens, Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Mons</b></li>
<li>The Canadian Corps however also lost 45,800 casualties</li>

<li>Sir Arthur Currie is one of the most respected leaders of WWI; responsible for much of the Canadians&rsquo; formidable reputation as fierce Soldiers</li>
<li>His strategic ability made his Military career incredibly impressive
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He was sometimes regarded as the <b>very Best Canadian Soldier</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many of his downfalls came from the controversies that circulated around him
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Currie embezzled $10,000 from the 50th regiment early on in his career which came back to haunt him</li>
<li><b>His publicly supporting Conscription in 1917 led to a bad reputation with Politicians back in Canada</b></li>

<li>Arthur was seen as a kind of person who <i>did what was necessary</i>

<li>In the Book <i>The Madman and the Butcher</i>, the Author sees Currie as one of our greatest military members; a person who did what was needed and sought out ways to protect his troops from slaughter constantly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Though it comes down to personal opinion, there is a lot in favour of Currie&rsquo;s reputation being false, and him caring a lot for his troops and just generally being a caring person faced with a brutal job</li>
<li>Sir Arthur Currie wasn&rsquo;t affable or charismatic, but what he was is efficient, intelligent, and strategic.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>During the entirety of the Great Depression, Canadians found themselves very frustrated with the mostly dual-party political system
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This leads to the rise of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation; founded in Calgary in 1932</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shortly after forming, in 1933, the party met in Regina to declare James Shaver Woodsworth the first president of the party</li>
<li>Through the Regina Manifesto, they wanted to:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eliminate Class/Economic based Division</li>
<li>Provide people with a proper &ldquo;genuine Democratic self-government based upon economic equality&rdquo;</li>
<li>A mixed economy through Nationalization of key industries</li>
<li>A Welfare state with Universal Pensions</li>
<li>Health and Welfare Insurance</li>
<li>Family allowances</li>
<li>Employment Insurance</li>
<li>and Workers&rsquo; Compensation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strangely, going into WWII, the C.C.F was split between supporters of Canada&rsquo;s entry into the war, and supporters of Woodsworth&rsquo;s relentless Pacifism
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Major James William Coldwell who succeeded Woodsworth as party leader, favoured Canada&rsquo;s participation in the war</li>
<li>Under his moderate guidance, the party flourished and won the critical York South by-election in early 1942</li>

<li>Two massive Oil crises in the &rsquo;70s encouraged the Government to secure oil resources for Canadian Consumers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The NEP required much more Federal Government involvement in the energy sector to accomplish it&rsquo;s goals
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Government would therefore encourage new funding for research and development&#x2026; Which <b>came with new Taxes</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The NEP encouraged more local participation in Oil, and also helped consumers switch to Natural Gas and electricity for home heating to conserve Oil</li>
<li>Sources of controversy against the NEP included:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fear that Provinces would lose an important source of revenue</li>
<li>The limitations on Private Industry and Royalties paid to oil-producing Provinces that came with Price Controls.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NEP was based on the idea that <b>access to cheap Oil and Gas was a more public need than a free-market commodity</b></li>
<li>As Global Oil prices declined from 1983 to 1985, negotiations continued over the NEP to help Private Industry
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By this point, the Economic Conditions that led to the creation of the NEP no longer existed</li>
<li>PM Mulroney therefore proposed a new Energy Policy during his first term in Office which aimed to address the changes in the global Oil Market</li>
<li>The Western Accord on Energy went into effect on June 1, 1985 and ended the NEP and over 20 years of Federal Government Protectionism and regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The Program was created by the Federal Government of Canada under Pierre Trudeau&rsquo;s Liberal Party</li>
<li>Later, in 1981, a Federal-Provincial deal was made, and Peter Lougheed; the Alberta Premier, became involved</li>
<li>Even before the NEP, the country had developed <b>many Crown Corporations to play a variety of economic and policy roles in the decades before</b></li>
<li>Many Provincial Governments and Premiers felt the Federal Government&rsquo;s new involvement in Oil and Gas would lose them important sources of revenue</li>
<li>Complicating the situation even further was the recent Quebec Referendum on Sovereignty in 1980
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trudeau promised constitutional negotiations between the Provincial and Federal Governments, and negotiations over the NEP dominated Canadian Politics throughout 1981</li>
<li>The Quebec Premier: Rene Levesque, was now directly involved, pushing for a looser association where Provinces gad greater control over their own affairs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Oil-Producing Provinces were paid Royalties by the NEP</li>
<li>The Entire Private Industry of Oil, Gas, and Natural Energy as a whole were now subject to very limited profits</li>

</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The main objective of the Program was <b>Protectionism</b> for the country&rsquo;s energy consumption
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They wanted to increase Canada&rsquo;s participation in Oil and Gas, establish fair energy pricing for Canadian Consumers, and secure Canada&rsquo;s Oil and Gas supply</li>
<li>It would also have made the market closed off; independence from the world Oil market</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This marks one of many big instances of <b>Provincial and Federal Governments opposing one another</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Governments from Provinces such as Alberta feared the NEP and Canada&rsquo;s new Energy Policy would lose them a large revenue source</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The decay of the NEP led to Mulroney&rsquo;s Government establishing the Western Accord on Energy in 1985
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This ended the over 20 years of Federal Government Protectionism and Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many of the economic factors that led to the Program&rsquo;s creation no longer applied by when it was finally created
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Global Economic and Political trends shifted in favour of deregulation and privatization in the economy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The NEP now reflects Canada&rsquo;s participation in these growing international trends</li>
<li>Though it failed, the NEP played a key role in the development of Canada&rsquo;s modern energy industry</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Program was incredibly controversial; it was initially popular with consumers as a symbol of Canadian Economic Nationalism, but private industry and some Provincial Governments opposed</li>
<li>The Program&rsquo;s success would mean Canada&rsquo;s energy-independence</li>
<li>The Federal Government being more involved with the energy sector introduced more Taxes and Price Controls</li>
<li>Natural Resources traditionally were the responsibility of the Provinces, and Premiers thought such a major change in Canada&rsquo;s energy policy should have involved Provincial Consultation

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>NAFTA has always been met with lots of Criticism; usually for very good reasons</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The North America Free Trade Agreement was an economic free trade agreement signed between Canada, the US, and Mexico
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>This would eliminate every single trade border and all investment barriers between the countries</b></li>
<li>This agreement built upon the previously signed Canada-US Free Trade Agreement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Over the course of the &rsquo;80s and into the &rsquo;90s, many Political and Economic factors led to the creation of NAFTA
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The idea was initially raised by President Reagan in 1979, but both Canada and Mexico showed no interest towards it over their wariness of US dominance</li>
<li>In 1984, however, after PM Mulroney was put in office following Trudeau, his Progressive Conservative Party led to the creation of CUSFTA</li>
<li>This was met with strong opposition from the Liberal and New Democratic Parties and much of the general public</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Later, the idea to include Mexico was much more controversial, following 1981-82 when Mexico experienced a debt crisis</li>
<li>Finally, however, after 14 intense months of negotiations, between 1991 and 1992, NAFTA was signed</li>
<li>The Agreement saw criticism in Canada and the US, as it was seen to be dominated by corporate interests
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fears arose of poor working conditions, low environmental standards, and the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to Mexico</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most representatives from the three countries praised the Agreement as having a very beneficial impact since it&rsquo;s creation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NAFTA overall had a major impact on the Canadian Economy, and has exponentially increased trade between the three countries in a few decades</li>
<li><i>It&rsquo;s important to note that regional supply chains were a big side effect of the agreement</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many economic sectors; particularly automobiles, have become very integrated across the continent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many argued that increased trade didn&rsquo;t lead to improved standards of living in the three countries</li>
<li>Canada sufferred greatly from Chapter 11 on Investment within the Agreement; giving way to many lawsuits against Canada from the other countries
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most cases brought against Canada challenged Government Policies aimed at Protecting the Environment or Managing Resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since NAFTA didn&rsquo;t create any significant institutions, there was little room for co-operation between the three countries after the Agreement was signed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Following 9/11, a new form of co-operation - motivated primarily by US security concerns, was implemented</li>
<li>Along it&rsquo;s two land borders, the US began involving the individual inspection of virtually all vehicles done by border agents, which slowed trade between the countries down to a crawl</li>
<li>Agreements were signed between Canada and the US, and Mexico and the US to improve the state of things, but cross-border movement of goods and people remained constrained</li>
